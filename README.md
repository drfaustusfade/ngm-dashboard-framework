## Getting started

Install bower and gulp:

npm install -g bower
npm install -g gulp-cli
```

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/pfitzpaddy/ngmaterialize-dashboard-framework
cd ngmaterialize-dashboard-framework
```

You can start the sample dashboard, by using the server gulp task:

```
