# ngmaterialize-dashboard-framework

> Dashboard framework with Angular.js and Materialize.

## Getting started

Install bower and grunt:

```bash
npm install -g bower
npm install -g grunt-cli
```

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pfitzpaddy/ngmaterialize-dashboard-framework
cd ngmaterialize-dashboard-framework
```

Install npm and bower dependencies:

```bash
npm install
bower install
```

You can start the sample dashboard, by using the server grunt task:

```bash
grunt server
```

Now you open the sample in your browser at http://localhost:9001/sample

Or you can create a release build of angular-dashboard-framework and the samples:

```bash
grunt

```
The sample and the final build of angular-dashboard-framework are now in the dist directory.
